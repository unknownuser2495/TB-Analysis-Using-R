Certainly! Here are 10 simple analyses you can perform using base R, without any additional libraries:

1. **Calculate Summary Statistics**:
   ```R
   summary(data)
   ```

2. **Mean Incidence, Prevalence, and Mortality Rates**:
   ```R
   mean_incidence <- mean(data$e_inc_100k, na.rm = TRUE)
   mean_prevalence <- mean(data$e_prev_100k, na.rm = TRUE)
   mean_mortality <- mean(data$e_mort_exc_tbhiv_100k, na.rm = TRUE)
   print(paste("Mean Incidence:", mean_incidence))
   print(paste("Mean Prevalence:", mean_prevalence))
   print(paste("Mean Mortality:", mean_mortality))
   ```

3. **Bar Chart of Incidence by Region**:
   ```R
   region_incidence <- tapply(data$e_inc_100k, data$g_whoregion, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
   barplot(region_incidence, main = "Incidence by Region", xlab = "Region", ylab = "Incidence Rate")
   ```

4. **Scatter Plot of Incidence vs. Prevalence**:
   ```R
   plot(data$e_inc_100k, data$e_prev_100k, main = "Incidence vs. Prevalence", xlab = "Incidence Rate", ylab = "Prevalence Rate")
   ```

5. **Correlation Between Incidence and Prevalence**:
   ```R
   cor_value <- cor(data$e_inc_100k, data$e_prev_100k, use = "complete.obs")
   print(paste("Correlation between Incidence and Prevalence:", cor_value))
   ```

6. **Trend Over Time for Incidence**:
   ```R
   plot(data$year, data$e_inc_100k, type = "l", main = "Trend of Incidence Over Time", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Incidence Rate")
   ```

7. **Boxplot of Incidence by Region**:
   ```R
   boxplot(data$e_inc_100k ~ data$g_whoregion, main = "Incidence by Region", xlab = "Region", ylab = "Incidence Rate")
   ```

8. **Count of Cases by Gender**:
   ```R
   gender_counts <- table(data$sex)
   print(gender_counts)
   ```

9. **Mean Age of Patients**:
   ```R
   mean_age <- mean(data$age, na.rm = TRUE)
   print(paste("Mean Age of Patients:", mean_age))
   ```

10. **Histogram of Incidence Rates**:
    ```R
    hist(data$e_inc_100k, main = "Distribution of Incidence Rates", xlab = "Incidence Rate", breaks = 50)
    ```

These analyses use base R functions to perform basic summary statistics, visualizations, and simple correlations. They should help you get started with understanding your TB dataset.
