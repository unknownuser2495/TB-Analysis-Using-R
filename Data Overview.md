Given this data, you could explore various research questions, such as:

    Trends over time: How have incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates changed over the years?
    Geographic variations: Are there differences in tuberculosis burden across different countries or regions?
    Risk factors: What factors are associated with higher or lower risk of tuberculosis (e.g., age, gender, HIV co-infection)?
    Treatment effectiveness: How effective are different treatments for tuberculosis?
    Impact of public health interventions: What is the impact of prevention and control measures on tuberculosis burden?
